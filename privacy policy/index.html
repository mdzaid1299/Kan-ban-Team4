                                        When you register for a new account (i.e. myaccount.kanbantool.com), you become a data controller responsible for everything that is stored under that account, as well as for management and lawful processing of personal data, including personal data of
                                        any users you invite. Thus it's essential for you to know what data we collect and how we process it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        During registration we collect some personal information which includes your email address, name and IP address of the computer you are connecting from, the website you are coming from and information about the referring search engine phrase or marketing
                                        campaign details.

                                        In particular, your email address helps us verify your identity when you contact us or require assistance with password reset, while referral details help us identify where people find out and learn about our services.

                                        You can update the data on "My profile" and "Account administration" pages. If you wish for us to stop processing this data, you can terminate the account on the "Account administration > Account details" page. Some data may survive erasure i.e. your
                                        account name, payments history or usage statistics.

                                        Please bear in mind, that account administrators can limit or revoke your access to the content you've provided, and you may not be able to get it back. Also, if the provided content includes personal data of others, as a data controller you or your account

                                        menu, or clicking the trash icon near the comment you've made).

                                        Payment processing is done through a secure third-party service. Once you decide to activate a subscription or make a payment, you will be redirected to a designated third-party payment processor which will collect data on their behalf.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We receive and process some of the information you provide to the payment processor, i.e. the country of credit card issuance, card's expiration date and the billing address you have entered.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We may use it i.e. for credit card fraud screening, or to assign the payment to an appropriate source country for EU VAT purposes - in the event you haven't given us any details about your current country of residence.
                                    </p>

                                        On no occasion we store or have access to the full credit card number you have provided.

                                        In order for us to issue tax invoices for the service, we need to store and process your invoicing details, together with an optional billing contact email address. You can access and modify this information when needed on the "Account administration
                                        > Plan &amp; Billing details" page.

                                        The main purpose of log data collection is for legal and regulatory reasons, to aim with the identification of the source of any potential security breaches or misuse of the service, for request rate limiting, and for service performance profiling.

                        We use collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, compliance and research.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How we share your information?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of the service is fostering and providing means of collaboration between individuals and teams. We share your information with other people on your account as part of providing the service to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also share information with third-party service providers, such as hosting, payment processing and backup services, but only within the scope which is needed by such provider to provide the service on our behalf, under instructions given by us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain Power-Ups or service integrations (i.e. Google Drive integration), when enabled, may share some of your information with third-parties in order to make the desired Power-Up or service integration work as intended. Account administrators have full
                        control over what Power-Ups or service integrations are enabled on their account. Also, any custom code or scripts enabled on the account, if designed so, may share your or other account user's data.

                    <p>
                        We may also share your information when we have received your consent to do so, or when required for compliance with applicable law, or to protect our rights.

                    <h2>Lawfulness of processing</h2>
                    <p>
                        We collect and use information about you only when we have a legal basis to do so under the applicable EU law. Legal basis will depend on the type of information concerned and the specific context, but we normally collect the information only: a) when
                        we need it to provide you with or operate the offered service; b) where you have given us an explicit consent for processing, i.e. with a newsletter subscription; c) when it satisfies our legitimate interest such as research and
                        development, compliance, security or marketing; d) when we need to comply with a legal obligation.

                                    If you are given the "delete" option on the content you or others have provided to the service, the underlying data will usually be only marked as deleted. It may remain accessible to you and others, and subject to recovery i.e. on the "trash" page.

                                    Tasks and boards marked as deleted are erased from our database usually within 21 days. We take care to remove as much information as possible, but there may be certain associated data that survives deletion, for legal, technological or other reasons
                                    - i.e. name and some other details of the deleted task will remain visible in the board's changelog even after it's deletion.

                                    Otherwise, we retain your account and associated content until the account owner decides to cancel the entire account. Following the cancellation, the account will be queued for removal from our database, and actual removal will usually happen within
                                    30 days. Please contact us during that time if you want to speed up this process or recover a mistakenly canceled account.

                                    some of the information for legal or other reasons, where allowed by the applicable EU privacy laws.

                                    We store encrypted, off-site backups of our database to restore the Service from them in case of any serious incidents. Data stored in such backups is not actively processed or accessed, and we take care to remove backups once they are no longer needed.
                                    If at any point we need to recover the Service from such backups, we will re-delete the accidentally recovered data as soon as reasonably possible.

                        Your content remains yours, and account owners can request a dump of content associated with their account in a machine-readable, portable format.
